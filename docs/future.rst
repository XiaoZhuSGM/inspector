Future
======

Inspector is a very early stage app,
so the priority is to polish the existing functionality
and complete whatever is missing.

Once that is done, next things to focus on could be:

* Status page / dashboard
* Simplified rules editing (ie. :code:`table.column` is unique)
* Notifications
* Automated table profiling
